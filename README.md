## Contribute

```bash
# 1. Build automation tools
make build

# This compiles all automation tools:
# - create-talk (create new talk directories)
# - generate-index (update talks index)
# - check-metadata (validate metadata files)
# - generate-stats (generate statistics)

# 2. Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
pip install pre-commit  # or brew install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

> **Note**: All automation is built using Go. Run `make build` to compile the binaries.

### Creating a New Talk

```bash
# Use the Makefile command
make create-talk DATE=2025-11-15 SLUG=my-awesome-talk

# Or use the shorter alias
make new DATE=2025-11-15 SLUG=my-awesome-talk

# This creates:
# - 2025/nov-15th-my-awesome-talk/
# - metadata.yaml (edit this!)
# - README.md
# - README-es.md
```

### Updating the Index

```bash
# After creating or editing talks
make update-index

# Or simply
make regen
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Once installed, pre-commit hooks will:
- ✅ Auto-generate index on commit
- ✅ Validate metadata files
- ✅ Check for missing files
- ✅ Fix trailing whitespace

```bash
# Manual run
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Quick Commands

```bash
make help           # Show all commands
make build          # Build automation tools
make install        # Alias for build
make create-talk    # Create new talk (requires DATE and SLUG)
make new            # Alias for create-talk
make update-index   # Regenerate index
make generate-stats # Generate statistics
make check          # Validate metadata
make clean          # Cleanup
```

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create talk
make create-talk DATE=2025-12-10 SLUG=kubernetes-secrets

# 2. Edit metadata
vim 2025/dec-10th-kubernetes-secrets/metadata.yaml

# 3. Add content
vim 2025/dec-10th-kubernetes-secrets/README.md

# 4. Update index
make update-index

# 5. Commit (pre-commit does the rest!)
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add Kubernetes secrets talk"
```
